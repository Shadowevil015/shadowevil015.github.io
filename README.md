# Shadowevil015.github.io
If you've found this repository, you're probably wondering what its for.

This is for my website, which is used to host my Launcher, used for modpacks. It also has updates on the modpacks, and a list of mods for each modpack.

Currently, it's written in HTML and CSS, but a Bootstrap 5 re-write may happen in the future.

If you need to contact me, my Discord is ShadowEvil015#8887
